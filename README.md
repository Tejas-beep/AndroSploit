#### Complete Automation to get a Meterpreter session in One Click

This tool can automatically __Create__, __Install__, and __Run__ payloads on target devices using __Metasploit-Framework__ and __ADB__ to gain control over Android devices with an open ADB port `TCP 5555`.

The goal of this project is to simplify penetration testing and vulnerability assessment on Android devices. Now you don't have to learn complex commandsâ€”AndroSploit automates the process for you.

> [!TIP]
> __AndroSploit__ can also function as a complete ADB Toolkit, allowing various operations on Android devices over Wi-Fi as well as USB.
