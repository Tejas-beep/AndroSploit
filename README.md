#### Complete Automation to get a Meterpreter session in One Click

This tool can automatically __Create__, __Install__, and __Run__ payloads on target devices using __Metasploit-Framework__ and __ADB__ to gain control over Android devices with an open ADB port `TCP 5555`.

The goal of this project is to simplify penetration testing and vulnerability assessment on Android devices. Now you don't have to learn complex commands‚ÄîAndroSploit automates the process for you.

> [!TIP]
> __AndroSploit__ can also function as a complete ADB Toolkit, allowing various operations on Android devices over Wi-Fi as well as USB.

# üí° Tutorial


## Setting up Android Phone for the first time

* __Enabling the Developer Options__

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Go to `About Phone`.
3. Find `Build Number`.
4. Tap on `Build Number` 7 times.
5. Enter your pattern, PIN or password to enable the `Developer options` menu.
6. The `Developer options` menu will now appear in your Settings menu.

* __Enabling USB Debugging__

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Go to `System` > `Developer options`.
3. Scroll down and Enable `USB debugging`.

* __Connecting with Computer__

1. Connect your Android device and `adb` host computer to a common Wi-Fi network.
2. Connect the device to the host computer with a USB cable.
3. Open a terminal in the computer and enter the following command :
```
adb devices
```
4. A pop-up will appear in the Android phone when you connect your phone to a new PC for the first time : `Allow USB debugging?`.
5. Click on `Always allow from this computer` check-box and then click `Allow`.
6. Then in the terminal enter the following command :
```
adb tcpip 5555
```
7. Now you can connect the Android Phone with the computer over Wi-Fi using `adb`.
8. Disconnect the USB cable.
9. Go to `Settings` >  `About Phone` > `Status` > `IP address` and note the phone's `IP Address`.
10. Run __AndroSploit__ and select `Connect a device` and enter the target's `IP Address` to connect over Wi-Fi.
